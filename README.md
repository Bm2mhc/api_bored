# api_bored
  This is an example of a very simple app using an API. Namely we use pure javascript embedded directly in an HTML file, to get results from an API called <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/documentation">the "bored" API</a>.
  We also use a js framework called <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>, to ease json formatting. 
  Lastly we use a rather complex css boilerplate, <a href="https://materializecss.com/cards.html">materialize</a>, which gives us some rather cool layouts. 
  Hence the project presents a set of meaningful skills and architecture in frontend web-programming.
